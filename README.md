# ng-pos

___ng-pos___ is an aptly-named web application whose job,\
other than giving me migraines, malnutrition and mild depression,\
is simple inventory management.

About this project:

### Once upon a stupid cool idea
"I'm going to start today"\
"Oh I'm _so_ excited!"\
"What technologies will I use?"\
"What will I call this project?"\
"Frontend first or backend first?"\
"wow, It's been 3 hours. Time to do this tomorrow"

### If it looks like a rubber duck...
"Ok, this is gonna take way more time than I thought it would"\
"Who knew building databases could be so much work. I need an ORM"\
"Why do I have all these controllers, this project is supposed to be simple!"\
"Uh, hello Mr. Client, I'm gonna need an additional 4 weeks on this project. Yeah, we have unforeseen circumstances. Cool, thanks"

### Mid-project madness
"Ok if I can get this simple feature in, I take a 30min break"\
"Ok if I can get this module to compile, I celebrate tonight"\
"Ok if I can get this method to work, I buy myself a new phone"\
"Ok if this statement returns 0, I will singlehandedly end corruption in this country!"\

### The fallout
"Eric, could you get off the computer and come have dinner with the family"\
"Eric, would you like to go to the movies, that movie you've been waiting for is finally showing. No? Why?"\
"Eric what are you doing up, It's 2am!"\
"Eric, we need to talk. You've been so withdrawn of late"\
_git commit -am "my family thinks I'm going nuts"_

### EEHH! WRONG!
_Error : Compile failed: The compiler has an Identity crisis, see it was created a compiler but it has always felt like an IoC container._\
_Error on line 254: No such class as 'Person'. No such thing as your code compiling on the first try either._\
_Error: You. Good luck trying to fix this._\
"Maybe I'll find the solution in one of these cat vines."

### All bad things must come to an end
"Ok I'm releasing today."\
"Oh, but I'm 2 weeks early, I guess I could add this one nice-to-have feature"\
"I also totally rushed over this component. Lemme re-write it."\
"Why won't it build?"\
_git reset --hard HEAD_
